        <h1> Project Idea </h1>
        <h3> Overview </h3>
        <p> My project idea is a video game made via unity focusing on building on top of concepts established in the sandbox and farming-sim genre.
          This will be done via approaching the themes and mechanics of the game with a more dark fantasy setting with extra emphasis on combat and settlement construction/defence.
          This project will also take on either a 2d or 2.5d style to limit scope to ensure the project's baseline is achievable </p>
        <h3> Motivation </h3>
        <p> My motivation for this project idea stems from the idea that most farm-sim/sandbox games akin to minecraft and stardew valley are mostly lighthearted and hopeful
           whereas this project intends to be more dark and gritty offering challenging experiences whilst still keeping the more relaxing aspects of intact allowing users to tackle
            the content available at their own pace. Furthermore, the genre combination of sandbox/dark fantasy style of game does not seem to be a market that is well capitalised on
             with most games belonging to the 2d <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://store.steampowered.com/tags/en/Dark%2BFantasy&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1648192917689961&usg=AOvVaw2CbRLq-dKQZa7tQENdLJ-A">dark fantasy</a> genre being rpg/roguelike games as dictated by the dark fantasy tag on steam. </p>
        <h3> Description </h3>
        <p>This project focuses on being a sandbox, dark fantasy themed game with some rpg elements. This takes place through the use of randomly generated environments with various “dungeon” like areas
           that are put together using prefabs in order to create procedural areas that are still maintaining an aspect of quality.  These areas would include randomised enemies, conditions and layouts
           to ensure each attempt is fresh and interesting whilst not getting too repetitive after playing for extended periods of time. Enemy types would include typical fantasy things such as skeletons,
           goblins and undead, additionally other enemy types would be inspired from lovecraftian mythology as to create an element of horror to the general feeling of the project. In regards to environmental
            choices I the game would have a washed out colour pallette only breaking this convention for player made safe areas after a significant amount of time invested, this is a feature / aesthetic choice
            intends to encourage users/players to spend time in areas they find interesting and invest time in expanding areas of their choosing. This expansion can be done via a settlement system that the player
            may choose to invest their time into allowing them to build up a safe village of sorts to help shelter npc’s from the harsh environments outside. From these settlements players should be able to make
            use of the skills of various npcs like blacksmithing and alchemy in order to help them progress further in the world easier. The combat would rely more on well-time dodges and attacks rather than
            basic spamming found in similar games to reflect the punishing nature of the games world whilst also being more accessible for players who may opt for a more magic and or ranged focus class that
            may be added past the initial versions. Moreover, the world should be designed so that the further you out you get the more harsh generation should apply with the middle being the easiest area
            so that the game does not immediately punish the user for playing. Biomes include heavy fantasy forests and lakes to dark washed out wastes with these biomes all having their own tilesets
            and enemy types (however this may take time and as such beginning builds may only include few biomes). Ultimately this project should be a procedurally generated world with rpg elements such
            as the use of stats, levelling systems and different weapons and armours to equip. </p>
        <h3> Tools and Technologies </h3>
        <p> As the game is intended to be made in a pixel art style I will use the Aseprite, Aseprite is a pixel art program that also allows the creation of animations and exportation of sprite sheets so
           that I may use them in unity. As mentioned prior I have chosen unity to create the game rather than any other program as it is said to work better with 2/2.5d than something like unreal engine. </p>
        <h3> Skills Required </h3>
        <p> Skills required include C# coding knowledge although unity may not need in-depth knowledge. Pixel art ability is also a required skill as the game will heavily depend on pixel styled assets and environments.
           Additionally it will likely be required to have knowledge of unity and how to use its various features,  most importantly how to work with sprites and sprite sheets. Some knowledge of animation may also be
            wanted but less required as this skill can be built over the course of the project. </p>
        <h3> Outcome </h3>
        <p> At the end of the project there should be a basic build of the game which should at least include character sprites, character combat and enemies. This should be more of a proof of concept due to the
           time constraints of the project making it unlikely that a full working project will be completed. This build should address the initial idea of making a sandbox game with rpg elements allowing players to
           access basic game systems like levels, combat and basic elements of the settlement system (this is at the most successful level). </p>
